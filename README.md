# BasicCI
This project contains code I wrote while following [Learn Continuous Integration with Bitbucket Pipelines](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/tutorials/continuous-integration-tutorial) tutorial by Atlassian.

### Description
The __BasicCI__ project is written using `Node 10` and uses `Express` to create a simple Node web server that displays 
"Hello World!" in the browser. To run the app use the command:
```
npm start
```
